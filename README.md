All the contents of the model can be found in the follwowing google drive folder
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RLrCcCgTbwK3wt0Sc75-BXQt9AFIvjed?usp=sharing

For the yolov5n model file go to Best_Model\models\yolov5n.yaml

For the best weights after training the yolov5n model go to Best_Model\runs\train\yolov5s_results\weights

For all the training related results like the P-curve, R_curve, results, confusion matrix go to Best_Model\runs\train\yolov5s_results

To check-out the predictions made by the yolov5n model on the test set go to Best_Model\runs\detect\exp

To check-out all the test/train/validation images with annotation go to Best_Model\Traffic-Sign-Detection-4
